*Crystal Qian et al. (7)* · Score: 8.36 · 2025-09-11
> This paper empirically compares behavioral differences between humans, frontier large language models, and customized Bayesian Agents in dynamic multi-party bargaining games. The study finds that while LLMs and humans achieve comparable total surplus, LLMs tend towards conservative concession strategies whereas humans follow fairness norms, revealing substantial procedural differences masked by performance equality metrics.

*Chen Xiong et al. (5)* · Score: 8.33 · 2026-02-03
> This paper reveals the steering externality phenomenon, where activation steering using benign datasets unintentionally weakens the safety guardrails of large language models. Experiments indicate that this intervention, aimed at improving model utility, conversely amplifies jailbreak vulnerabilities, raising attack success rates in standard benchmarks to over 80%. The study emphasizes the necessity of strictly scrutinizing unintended safety externalities arising from utility improvements during inference.

> This paper introduces the Sketch2Code benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of Visual Language Models (VLMs) to convert sketches into web prototypes through interactive agent assessments that simulate real design workflows. An analysis of ten commercial and open-source models reveals that existing models still struggle with accurately interpreting sketches and asking effective questions, highlighting the necessity for developing multi-turn dialogue agents.
